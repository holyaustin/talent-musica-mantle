# Talent Musica - Onboarding new music talents into web3.

## Summary
Talent Musica is a web3 DApp that allows young music talents to upload their songs or performance as NFTs into the Talent Marketplace. Producers, Music Promoters, and other music industry talent scouts can review various videos from talents and contact any talent they love their work.

The core feature of the app is that we don't play middle men. Talents get contatced by music producers who like their work.

Our goal is to harness the power of blockchain in music industry, we can onbaord new music talents into the web3 space and incentivise them. 

## Introduction
This project is a Hackathon project sponsored by DevPost - Spheron dAppAthon. The project aims to create an on-chain music Dapp where young music talents can upload their creation and mint it to the talent marketplace as Video NFTs. If users like the music, such artists can be contacted on their Twitter handles. Producers and Managers who look at the work of any upcoming artiste/talent can get the talent and sign a contract with him/ her.
